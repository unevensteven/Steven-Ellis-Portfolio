    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio.</h1>

    <h3>My name is Steven, </h3>
    
    <h4>Welcome to my webpage!</h4>


    <p>I am an experienced engineer with a passion for technology and a deep interest in web development and software engineering. With a solid foundation in engineering principles and a keen eye for detail, I bring a unique perspective to the world of programming.</p>

    <p>Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to travel extensively, broadening my horizons and gaining valuable insights into different cultures and perspectives. These experiences have shaped my ability to adapt, think creatively, and approach problem-solving with an open mind, whilst learning to speak another language.</p>
        
    <p>As I embark on my journey to become a web developer and software engineer, I am excited to combine my technical expertise with my passion for creating intuitive and user-friendly digital experiences. I thrive on the challenges that come with building robust and efficient applications, and I am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry best practices.</p>
        
    <p>I started the SCS-Coalition scheme in 2023, and this webpage serves as a platform to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements.  Feel free to explore and learn more about my work. I am always eager to collaborate on exciting ventures and contribute to innovative solutions.</p>
